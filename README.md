# nilnul.fs._git_._LIB_

Search for git.exe, starting from the location configured;

Call Git.exe to finish many tasks, including:
- automatically split large file such that it's under the limit (for example 100MB) of well-known servers;

Call server Api to, say, 
- create repos;
- create remotes;

The code is organized in a more understandable (in our view, as some cmd parameters are hard to remember where to place) way so it can also act as a hand book when we need to check out what to do, which we previously jotted down in the code;

The code style conforms to nilnul code style, as maintained in project: nilnul._dev_
