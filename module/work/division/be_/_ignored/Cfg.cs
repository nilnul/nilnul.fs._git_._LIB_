Your .gitignore is shared across team members as a file committed and pushed to the nilnul.win.prog_.Git repo. To exclude files only on your system without pushing the changes to the rest of your team, edit the .git/info/exclude file in your local repo. Changes to this file will not be shared with others and only apply to the files in that repo. The syntax for this file is the same as the one used in .gitignore.*/
