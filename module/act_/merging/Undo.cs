	If you get stuck and decide to just give up and throw the whole mess away, you can always return to the pre-merge state with

$ git reset --hard HEADOr, if you’ve already committed the merge that you want to throw away,

$ git reset --hard ORIG_HEADHowever, this last command can be dangerous in some cases—never throw away a commit you have already committed if that commit may itself have been merged into another branch, as doing so may confuse further merges.
