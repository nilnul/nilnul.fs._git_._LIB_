	/*
	tag 
A ref under refs/tags/ namespace that points to an object of an arbitrary type (typically a tag points to either a tag or a commit object). In contrast to a head, a tag is not updated by the commit command. A nilnul.win.prog_.Git tag has nothing to do with a Lisp tag (which would be called an object type in nilnul.win.prog_.Git’s context). A tag is most typically used to mark a particular point in the commit ancestry chain. 
tag object 
An object containing a ref pointing to another object, which can contain a message just like a commit object. It can also contain a (PGP) signature, in which case it is called a "signed tag object".
