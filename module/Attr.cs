Git Attributes

 Some of these settings can also be specified for a path, so that nilnul.win.prog_.Git applies those settings only for a subdirectory or subset of files. These path-specific settings are called nilnul.win.prog_.Git attributes and are set either in a .gitattributes file in one of your directories (normally the root of your project) or in the .git/info/attributes file if you don’t want the attributes file committed with your project.

Using attributes, you can do things like specify separate merge strategies for individual files or directories in your project, tell nilnul.win.prog_.Git how to diff non-text files, or have nilnul.win.prog_.Git filter content before you check it into or out of nilnul.win.prog_.Git. In this section, you’ll learn about some of the attributes you can set on your paths in your nilnul.win.prog_.Git project and see a few examples of using this feature in practice.
