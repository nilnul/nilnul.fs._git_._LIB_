	The syntax to delete a branch is a bit arcane at first glance:
git push  <REMOTENAME> :<BRANCHNAME> 


Note that there is a space before the colon. The command resembles the same steps you'd take to rename a branch. However, here, you're telling nilnul.win.prog_.Git to push nothing into BRANCHNAME on REMOTENAME. Because of this, git push deletes the branch on the remote repository.

		git push origin :experimental
Find a ref that matches experimental in the origin repository (e.g. refs/heads/experimental), and delete it.
