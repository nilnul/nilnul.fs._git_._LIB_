The SSH agent you use will depend on your operating system but it shouldn't be hard to set up. With most popular Linux distros you shouldn't need to do anything and I have been informed in a comment below that you can set Windows up as follows:
git config --global credential.helper wincred


I have never used MacOSX so I cannot say for certain whether this is automatically set up like it is in Ubuntu based distributions.
