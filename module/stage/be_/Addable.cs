git diff [--options] [--] [<path>…​] 
This form is to view the changes you made relative to the index (staging area for the next commit). In other words, the differences are what you could tell nilnul.win.prog_.Git to further add to the index but you still haven’t. You can stage these changes by using git-add[1].

 git diff --no-ext-diff --quiet --exit-code


--exit-code 
Make the program exit with codes similar to diff(1). That is, it exits with 1 if there were differences and 0 means no differences.


--quiet 
Disable all output of the program. Implies --exit-code.
