	/*
You can apply and then drop a specific stash, too: git stash apply stash@{2}, and so on. Dropping a specific stash, renumbers only the higher-numbered ones. Again, the one without a number is also stash@{0}.
If you pile up a lot of stashes, it can get fairly messy (was the stash I wanted stash@{7} or was it stash@{4}? Wait, I just pushed another, now they're 8 and 5?). I personally prefer to transfer these changes to a new branch, because branches have names, and cleanup-attempt-in-December means a lot more to me than stash@{12}. (The git stash command takes an optional save-message, and those can help, but somehow, all my stashes just wind up named WIP on branch.)
